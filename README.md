This is a work in progress lamp setup for Magento projects. It'll eventually contain all the tools/packages I need to feel like I'm being a serious PHP developer and enough pre-installed front-end packages to ensure I'm down with the latest trends.

It's also my chance to play at devops cause the *nix and the command line are pretty hip.
